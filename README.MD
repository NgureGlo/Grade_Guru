## Project Overview
Grade Guru leverages machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics to analyze historical student data and forecast future academic performance. By providing real-time insights through a user-friendly interface, the system empowers educational institutions to take proactive measures in supporting students who may be at risk of underperforming.

The system's main objectives include:
1. Developing a predictive model to accurately forecast student performance.
2. Offering an intuitive web interface for accessing predictions, reports, and insights.
3. Ensuring scalability, data privacy, and system reliability.

## Features
- **Predictive Analytics:** Uses machine learning models to predict student performance and identify at-risk students based on historical academic data.
- **Data Visualization:** Displays performance trends and insights through charts and graphs.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** Provides an intuitive interface for educators and administrators to access predictions and generate reports.
- **Scalability:** Designed to accommodate growing data volumes and user numbers.
- **Data Privacy & Security:** Adheres to data protection standards to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of student data.

## System Architecture
The system architecture is organized into the following components:
1. **Data Sources:** Collects and stores student academic records and related data.
2. **Data Processing Layer:** Includes data ingestion (ETL), cleaning, feature engineering, and storage in a structured format.
3. **Prediction and Analytics Layer:** 
   - Implements machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
   - Uses the prediction engine for executing predictive analytics.
   - Continuously trains and refines the models using updated data.
4. **User Interface Layer:**
   - Provides dashboards for educators and tools for administrators to manage system configurations.
5. **Database Layer:** Stores structured data, ensuring efficient access and scalability.

## Tech Stack
The system is built using the following tools and technologies:
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib for data visualization
- **Version Control:** Git for tracking changes and collaboration

## Installation
To set up Grade Guru on your local machine:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/grade-guru.git
   cd grade-guru
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
5. **Access the Web Application:**  
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage
1. **Upload Student Data:** Use the dashboard to upload student academic records.
2. **Run Predictions:** Execute predictive analytics to identify at-risk students.
3. **Generate Reports:** Visualize student performance trends and access detailed reports.
4. **Monitor Feedback:** Continuously update the models and gather feedback from educators for improvement.

## Testing
The following types of testing are performed:
- **Unit Testing:** Tests individual functions, such as authentication and data processing.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensures seamless communication between frontend, backend, and database.
- **System Testing:** Validates overall system performance and user interactions.

To run tests, use:
```bash
pytest tests/
```
